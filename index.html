    <h2>What is This Symposium About?</h2>
    <p>
        Elucidating the physical landscape of biomolecules requires cross-platform efforts. From transportation mechanism of ion channels and transporters, to conformational dynamics of proteins, biophysicists have been employing multiple tools spanning different scales (e.g., cryo-EM, X-ray, NMR, fluorescent microscopy, MD simulations, molecular docking) to interrogate the molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
        How to find good computation techniques to provide further details or predict a problem? How to select the suitable methods to corroborate the computational findings? How to reach out for collaboration and work effectively with each other? Answering these questions would help build more high-quality collaborations and promote further scientific advance in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        The symposium consists of four seminar-style presentations, each lasts for 20 minutes, as well as a panel discussion on how to collaborate between computational and experimental groups. The symposium mainly targets early-career scientists, such as graduate students and postdocs. It is also highly welcome for principal investigators and younger undergraduates to join us, sharing insights or questions in the panel discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This event will be held on March 9, 2021 from 10:30 am - 12:30 pm in the Eastern Standard Time zone.

                Potassium channels are a class of ion channels that play critical roles in many biological functions, such as formation of the membrane potential and mediating electrical signals in excitable cells (e.g. neurons) . Structural and functional studies revealed the main features of these channels, including rapid and selective K+ ion permeation through a narrow selectivity filter (SF), channel opening and closure at the “helix bundle crossing” (activation gate), and distinct gating processes at the selectivity filter. Despite such insights, the molecular mechanisms of permeation, selectivity and gating phenomena remain largely unknown, and are further obscured by the differences between the numerous members of the potassium channel family.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 Nowadays, long Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations allow studying ion channels under applied voltage, enabling a direct comparison with experimentally measured single-channel currents in electrophysiological recordings, thus coining the name ‘in silico electrophysiology’. I will present such simulations of several potassium channels, all sharing nearly identical SFs. Our simulations reveal that potassium selectivity is directly linked to the level of ion desolvation during permeation. Strict K+ selectivity is observed only upon complete desolvation that simultaneously enables high conduction rates through the channel via strong repulsion of ‘naked’ K+ ions. This addressed the long-standing and intriguing question of how potassium channels manage to permeate potassium efficiently yet selectively against slightly smaller sodium. Furthermore, we have recently confirmed the full desolvation of the K+ ions by a combination of solid-state NMR and MD simulations.

Finally, our simulations revealed that the SF regulates the magnitude of ion flow through the channel, thus gating it on the molecular level. We identified an allosteric coupling that leads to subtle variations in the SF width, affecting the free energy barrier for ion permeation sufficiently to switch it from a closed to open state.
