    <h2>What is This Symposium About?</h2>
    <p>
        Elucidating the physical landscape of biomolecules calls for cross-platform efforts. From transportation mechanism of ion channels and transporters, to conformational dynamics of protein, biophysicists employ multiple tools spanning different scales (e.g., cryo-EM, X-ray, NMR, fluorescent microscopy, MD simulations, molecular docking) to interrogate the questions. Among such deployment of methods, computations and experiments represent two distinct disciplines, yet are increasing blending with and relying on each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The distinctive training and working styles in computations and experiments render some underlying differences in thinking and analyzing a research problem. How to select the suitable methods to corroborate the computational findings? How to find good computation techniques to provide further details or predict a problem? How to reach out for collaboration and work effectively with each other? Answering these questions would help build more high-quality collaborations and promote further scientific advance in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        The symposium consists of four seminar-style presentations, each lasts for 20 minutes, as well as a panel discussion on how to collaborate between computational and experimental groups. The symposium mainly targets early-career scientists, such as graduate students and postdocs. Certainly, it is also highly welcome for principal investigators and younger undergraduates to join us, sharing insights or questions in the panel discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This event will be held on March 9, 2021 from 10:30 am - 12:30 pm in the Eastern Standard Time zone.

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
